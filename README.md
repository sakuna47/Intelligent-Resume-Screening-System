# 🧠 Intelligent Resume Screening System

### AI-Powered Resume Shortlisting Using Machine Learning & NLP

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Intelligent Resume Screening System** is a machine learning–based application designed to automate the resume shortlisting process. It analyzes resumes using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and predicts candidate suitability based on job requirements, reducing manual effort and bias in recruitment.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **AI, NLP, and data science** in HR technology.
